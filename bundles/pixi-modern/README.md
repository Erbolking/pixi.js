PixiJS Modern
=============

This is the same package as **pixi.js** but it does _not_ contain support for falling back to CanvasRenderer. Older browsers, such as IE 9, will not be supported by using this package. It contains a much smaller footprint than **pixi.js**.

#### Install

```
$> npm install pixi-modern
```
